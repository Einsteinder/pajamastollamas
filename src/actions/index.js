The only downside is that they recommend washing these by hand which is a nuisance. I see other reviewers have machine washed them and theyâ€™ve been fine though but I donâ€™t want them to shrink or lose their softness or get damaged in any way so Iâ€™ll continue to hand wash them.BOTTOM LINE: highly recommended for their softness and breathability!
